# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction using 

## Introduction

Predictive analytics use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn. Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors, they are effective at focusing customer retention marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn.

## Objective

The cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one and retaning long-term customers can be worth much more to a company than newly recruited clients.
